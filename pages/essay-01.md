# 20th Century War Demonstrations

## Introduction

Here's some sample text, written in Markdown.
In Markdown, any text with no empty lines between will become a paragraph.

Leave an empty line between headings and paragraphs.

{% include feature/line-chart.html data="sotu-20th-century" topic="America as world power" %}

I thought this graph was interesting because the topic is about America as a world power but the high points of the topic were during the fifties and sixties. I would thought that America as a world power would have been more in the seventies and eighties when the Soviet Union fell and the US became more dominant.[^1]

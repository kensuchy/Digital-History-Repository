# Evolution of Women's Influence in America


## Introduction

---

During the nineteenth century women participated in politics and society in an ancillary way by working for the abolishment of slavery and supporting their husbands in their endeavors. But since the late eighteenth century when Abigail Adams implored her husband to include women in the political process of the new nation, women have wanted to have their voices heard. As the nineteenth century turned into the twentieth century women became more visible on the political landscape. The ratification of the nineteenth amendment by Congress and the willingness of politicians such as Franklin D. Roosevelt to include women in the national arena opened the doors during World War II so women were accepted in the workplace at a time when they needed to be there and provided the self confidence in their abilities to perform whatever tasks that were put in front of them.

## Womens Suffrage in Idaho

---

The women of Idaho won the right to vote in 1896 but the battle for those rights began long before that.  The story begins thirty years prior to that when representative Joseph William Morgan proposed a bill to provide for the vote for women. Morgan argued that women “ranked as a person, a citizen, and as such, being affected by the laws of the country, it was in accordance with democratic teachings that she be allowed a voice in the making of those laws. That government derived its validity and just power from the consent of the governed-that is, all who were governed.” Morgan’s bill failed in an 11-11 tie vote but the issue of woman’s suffrage surfaces again in 1885 and 1887.[^1]

As in the national arena the battle for women’s suffrage was closely tied to the temperance movement. Many Idaho women found their voice in the public sphere through participation in the Women’s Christian Temperance Union. Henrietta Skelton, a German native, who had emigrated to California, was a powerful public speaker and from her position as a national organizer for WCTU, encouraged local chapters to incorporate women’s suffrage into their cause. She gave a speech to the legislature requesting the following two clauses in the new state constitution: “No discrimination on account of sex shall be made; but citizens of both sexes, possessing the necessary qualifications, shall be equally eligible as electors;’ and “that manufacture, sale, or keeping of intoxicating liquors for use as a beverage is hereby prohibited.” For temperance activists in Idaho, women’s suffrage and prohibition were inseparable.

This connection of women’s suffrage to prohibition of alcohol by the WCTU created some problems. Many felt that the close association between the two might cost women the right to vote because of greater opposition from men. One such suffragette was Abigail Scott Duniway. She had spent decades working for women’s suffrage in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. She summered on a ranch in the Lost River Valley in south central Idaho on her son’s ranch. Her groundwork played an important part in Idaho’s adoption of women’s suffrage.[^2] She was well known as a speaker and newspaperwoman. She had previously spoke before Idaho’s legislature in 1887 in favor of women’s right to vote. She remembers receiving the following message in response to the WCTU position; “I received a message from my Equal Suffrage co-workers in Boise, urging me to come to them at once. “The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union is spoiling everything,” the letter said. “They have arranged for a hearing before the convention, in advance of ours, asking for a clause in the new Constitution to prohibit the liquor traffic. They won’t get it, of course, but they will prohibit us from getting a Woman Suffrage plank, if you don’t come!”[^3] She gave a speech to the legislature right after Skelton and attacked the idea that women’s suffrage and prohibition were connected and instead argued for the adoption of an independent women’s suffrage clause. Idaho did not give women the right to vote in the new state constitution, but Skelton and Duniway’s speeches reveal some of the tension in the relationship between women’s suffrage and temperance.

Because of the tie between temperance and suffrage. Liquor companies and secondary trades such as farmers, coopers and barrel-makers opposed women’s suffrage in Idaho. Duniway realized that women could not enfranchise themselves. She believed that women should not antagonize men but should appeal to men’s more noble instincts. In “How to Win the Ballot” she stated: ”The first fact to be considered, when working to win the ballot, is that there is but one way by which we may hope to obtain it, and that is by and through the affirmative votes of men… we must show them that we are inspired by the same patriotic motives that induce them to prize it … [and} impress upon all men the fact that we are not intending to interfere, in any way, with their rights; and we ask is to be allowed to decide, for ourselves, also as to what our rights should be.”[^4] This understanding prompted her to invoke concepts such as liberty and justice rather than women’s suffrage. She was known to lavish praise on pioneer men in their efforts to settle and clear the American soil.[^5] Through efforts of suffrage heroes such as Duniway and Skelton, even though they disagreed on the underlying issues, helped women to gain the vote in Idaho in 1896.

The quest for women’s suffrage in the west was successful earlier than that on the national level due to a notion that might be called western exceptionalism.[^6] They believed there was a spirit of freedom and independence fostered by the pioneer experience that was unique. It was also easier to shape new laws than try to overcome “tyrant” customs of the east. On the temperance front the WCTU continued their efforts erecting temperance water fountains, one of which still stands outside of Boise City Hall. They were successful in achieving the goal of temperance when Governor Moses Alexander approved statewide prohibition in 1916.

## Womens Suffrage for Minorities in Idaho

---

While 1896 amendment gave the vote to white women in Idaho and nationally in 1915, other women were not so lucky. Native born Indigenous women were granted the right to vote in 1896 but nationwide indigenous people were not able to participate in voting until the signing of the Indian Citizenship Act of June 2, 1924. It was hoped that this act would close the gap for Indigenous people but due to varying state and local laws until the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965.[^7] Indigenous women faced unique challenges as historian Sally Roesch Wagner wrote” “These women lived in native nations that tenaciously held on, as well as they could, to their system of real equality despite the best efforts of missionaries, boarding schools, and federal and state governments alike to deprive them of it. They still do, and are reclaiming their identity as ‘sovereign women in sovereign nations.’”[^8]

The Black women’s experience with suffrage is best summarized as follows in an article by the Southern Law Poverty Center: “We must recognize that women of color live in the world as women and as people of color simultaneously. Their experiences cannot and should not be separated to prioritize equality for one marginalized identity over another. The black and brown suffragists of history refused to do it—and so should we.”[^9] Black women like Indigenous women were left out of suffrage narratives. They often worked leading suffrage groups and campaigning for the vote but individual states prevented from voting until the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Little is known how Black women fared in Idaho’s suffrage campaign but efforts to prevent Black women and men from voting have been documented. The rights to vote were denied to John West, a Black man from Boise, in early June 1870 when he tried to participate in a local election. The Idaho Tri-Weekly Statesman wrote that West tried several times “to deposit his ballot but was refused the right. Probably those who had charge of the polls on Monday have not yet learned that congress has made provision to enforce the carrying out of the 15th amendment.”[^10] During an ensuing court case to resolve the results of that local election, the judge ruled John West’s vote valid and it was incorporated into the overall election tally.[^11]  Another example in a 1909 Boise election two Black women, Mrs. Hazel Beck and Mrs. B Thompson, were challenged on the basis that they were not residents. The challenges were overturned and their voted counted. These two instances were reported in the newspaper, there were probably many more that were not reported on.

The Hispanic population are absent from the history of voting in the early twentieth century. Their absence from the narrative speaks volumes of how they were treated. There is mention of Maria Dolores “Lola” Urquides Binnard. She was the daughter of Jesus Urquides Idaho’s premier muleteer and is one woman that improved the quality of life in her neighborhood.[^12] Lola was the proprietor of “Spanish Village” a collection of small cabins rented to packers and single men that was located at First and Main streets. One resident described Lola, 
"I speak for Mrs. Lola Binnard. I might say first why I praise her as a fine person. She is very careful to have about this quaint little village a good law abiding and a good clean minded people. If in case of illness of any person in this little village, Mrs. Binnard is on the job to see all is attended in the proper way. In case it becomes too much for her she sees to it that will take care of the patient. Yes, this place has been a haven for poor good and just people and Lola has been the queen and judge. Would anyone ask for more security in a haven of relaxation for tired people...Well I might add that I have been rather well contended here and expect to remain here."[^13] 

During her lifetime she was a registered voter and was active in local politics. The 1896 event created an environment where Lola could vote before most of the women in the country. Nationally, we find many Hispanic women working as activists and fighting for changes in labor laws and workers’ rights. These women embody the motto of Fuerza Unida, “La mujer luchando. El mundo transformando.” [“Women in struggle transform the world”].”[^14] Fuerza Unida was a group of women who organized support for workers when Levi’s Strauss Co. closed its factories in San Antonio, Texas. Women have been at the center of social movements improving the world around us. Su voto es su voz — your vote is your voice.

Chinese women could exercise the right to vote if they were native born. Chinese women in Boise were aware of national suffrage attempts as well as reforms in China. The Idaho Statesman printed a photo of Mabel Lee on April 22nd under the headline, “Chinese Woman Who Is a Suffragette.” The image caption included that “All Chinatown is proud of Mabel, who has been in this country seven years and is now ready to enter Barnard college. She and her mother are suffragett es [sic], and will participate in the great suffrage parade on May 4.”[^15] It is unclear whether Chinatown referred to the local one in Boise but given the context it appears it might be. Prior to the 1943 Magnuson Act, Chinese men and women were unable to become naturalized citizens which prevented them from voting. This did not stop them from working towards women’s suffrage. In Boise, a group known as the Chinese suffragettes entered floats in the fourth of July parades in 1917 and 1919 taking advantage of the fanfare of the celebrations. The Idaho Statesman reported about their 1917 efforts: “Three prominent members of the local Chinese colony, whom their husbands designate as the 'Chinese suffragettes' when they learned that the parade of next Wednesday was to exemplify the 'spirit of liberty,' decided they would take the matter into their own hands this year and plan a float themselves, one which should typify the Chinese spirit of liberty.”[^16] The women referenced were Mrs. Lucille (Lucy) Emow, Mrs. Fong Bow and Mrs Fong You. They created a float with a small Washington monument with one side showing a picture of George Washington and the other side a picture of Dr. Sun Yet Sen, the father of the Chinese republic.[^17] These women were proud of being Americans and wished to show their allegiance to the country of their adoption. Lucy Emow was registered to vote in Boise during 1917 as was her husband. Her right to vote was organized around an anti-Chinese sentiment.[^18] Despite this view Chinese women could vote in Idaho before their counterparts in the American west.

## Womens Suffrage on the National Scale

---

 In the late 19th century the standard for women was to be married and to work in the home raising their families. As the Progressive movement became popular women’s rights took more of a front row seat as the movement’s issues included the family and women’s rights. Organizations such as the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and the National Woman’s Suffrage Association worked to better women’s position in society. Urban women worked to clean up neighborhoods and get funding for parks. The work of Margaret Sanger championed birth control improving public health and reducing poverty by decreasing the size of families. The Women’s Christian Temperance Union lead the way for woman’s suffrage. They felt that if women could vote they would vote for prohibition and end the excesses caused by using alcohol. They ran a thriving journalistic enterprise, they marched on polls, they visited prisoners and participated in antivice crusades. Anna Howard Shaw lead the Women’s Christian Temperance Union suffrage division and when she became president of the NAWSA she brought this wealth of knowledge with her. The two main players in the fight for woman's suffrage was the NAWSA and the National Woman's Party (NWP). There were difference between the way they went about their crusade for suffrage. On one side they felt the right to vote had always belonged to them and that they needed to press for that right. This argument prompted them to take a highly visible role in getting suffrage passed including parades and poll marching. The more moderate group felt that they could show that women were good citizens and that by allowing women to vote this would create a better government. This idea fit in well with the Progressive party ideals and would appeal to the more conservative congress members. The NAWSA stated that women are keepers of their own homes by nature and training. Their desire was to do a bit of civic housekeeping and maybe even initiate an occasional "house cleaning".[^19] The natural right to vote had given way to working within the Progressive system. The NWP was seeking equality under the US political and legal framework not just being housekeepers on whatever level.

The women got their break in 1912 when the public soured on the antisuffragist lobbying by liquor dealers, textile owners and anti-reform politicians. The Progressive Party realized that they needed to empower their female allies and so they endorsed women’s suffrage. Intelligent well-spoken women began campaigning for suffrage which helped men to realize that giving them the vote would not be a terrible thing. Western states such as Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and Idaho had granted full women’s suffrage in 1900. Five more western states granted suffrage in 1912 and two more in 1917. Western states were open to new ideas and were not as dominated by vested interests as those in the east. A few states allowed women to vote in local elections but not in the national ones.

## Wilson's reticence

Woodrow Wilson stated that he felt chilled and scandalized whenever he saw and heard women speak in public.[^20] During his tenure as President he would have these feelings often. Women such as Alice Paul felt that they needed to make a public spectacle to get noticed to get women’s issues pushed forward. However, Wilson did not believe that suffrage warranted a position on the national front. He continued to overlook suffrage until 1916 when he attended a convention in Atlantic City and realized that suffrage was an issue. He leant his support to it but was very ambiguous about how it was to be implemented. This prompted the NAWSA to adopt a four-prong attack. They would approach the states who had adopted woman’s suffrage to lobby the federal government to adopt a constitutional amendment. They would increase their efforts in states where legislation was pending. In states where legislation was struggling they would attempt to get referendums passed that women would be only voting in national elections. In the south where fear that women’s suffrage would reengage Blacks who had become disenfranchised, they proposed that only primary elections would be affected which were already segregated. These steps fit into the political environment and excluded Alice Paul and her direct protest methods.

As the US entered World War I Wilson had to rally groups such as the womens groups he previously had ignored. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the NAWSA, had been a member of the Woman’s Peace Party and felt strongly against involvement in the war, but she pledged NAWSA to the war effort. To garner Wilson's favor she reasoned this would cause him to make concessions on women's rights at the end of the war. NAWSA members helped Councils on Preparedness in every state and recruited women to work in food production, the American Red Cross, and aid to soldiers stationed stateside. In June 1919 Wilson kept his part of the bargain and threw his support toward congressional passage of the 19th amendment enfranchising women. Legislators throughout the south adamantly opposed it but there was nearly enough support to ratify the amendment without them. Tennessee became the swing vote and Harry T. Burn in accordance with his mother’s wishes voted to approve women’s suffrage. With his single vote, women won the right to vote.

## The Vote is not Enough

---

By being able to vote in elections, women found that they had a voice in the decisions being made locally and nationally. But having the vote sometimes is not enough. Shortly after winning the right to vote, members of the National Woman’s Party including Crystal Eastman and Alice Paul drafted the Equal Rights Amendment. A version of the amendment was proposed in each session of Congress until 1970. Just as when women were fighting for abolition of slavery and because of this exposure their own goals of suffrage for women were promoted, the fight for the Equal Rights Amendment in many ways had ties to the Civil Rights Movements of the sixties and seventies. In the sixties women got involved with protesting the war in Viet Nam and working for civil rights for the Blacks. Sarah M. Evans, in the article “Sons, Daughter, and Patriarchy: Gender and the 1968 Generation” asserts that by looking at women’s roles in 1968 activism, the groundwork of female leadership in the feminist movement can be found.[^21] Evans supports this assertion by examining the struggle where women had to assert themselves even in these “radical” environments, often being assigned domestic or clerical tasks instead of leadership roles. Through these struggles, the publics perspective of women changed, allowing them to have a public voice and leading to acceptance of women’s leadership. These relationships help set up the Equal Rights Act of 1972.

## Enter The ERA

---

{% include feature/image.html filename="Chisholm_Shirley square.jpg" alt="Photo of Shirley Chisholm" caption="Shirley Chisholm ERA Advocate" %}

  Rep. Shirley Chisholm was elected in 1968 as the first African American congresswoman. While in the House she delivered a speech in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment, saying that “a constitution written without input from the nation's founding mothers or founding fathers of color is incomplete.” She felt that it was not too late to pass the ERA. "Of course, laws will not eliminate prejudice from the hearts of human beings,” she said. “But that is no reason to allow prejudice to continue to be enshrined in our laws, to perpetuate injustice through inaction." Chisholm spent her life fighting for social justice and educational opportunities for people of color. She became the first African American from a major party to run for president. Despite being underfinanced, she entered twelve primaries and garnered 152 delegates, 10 percent of the total. With a constitution that only protected white, male interests, she said, “Tremendous amounts of talent are lost to our society just because that talent wears a skirt."[^22]
  
{% include feature/image.html filename="Phyllis Schlafly.jpg" alt="Photo of Phyllis Schlafly" caption="Phyllis Schlafly ERA Opponent" %}
   
Just Idaho was a frontrunner in allowing women to vote, in 1972, Idaho was among the first states to ratify the ERA, approving it overwhelmingly in the House and in the Senate. However in 1977, the Idaho Legislature voted narrowly to rescind its ratification. So, why the change of heart between 1972 and 1977? There were shifts in the makeup of the Idaho Legislature but not enough to explain the change in support for the ERA. During this period Phyllis Schlafly launched a huge nationwide lobby against the ERA. Schlafly is widely recognized as the one who halted the momentum of the ERA. After the ratification effort failed, Schlafly proclaimed, “The career most women want is marriage, home, husband, and children,.” In Idaho, there was questions about whether the ratification could be rescinded without a two-thirds majority. This decision ended up in Federal court as the Eagle Forum, an organization that Schlafly helped organize, joined the Idaho Legislature and the state of Idaho to seek a court ruling. U.S. District Judge for Idaho Marion J. Callister ruled in 1982 that the ratification process has distinct roles for Congress and the states, and the ratification process was up to the states – so the states could decide individually what rules they applied, including whether a two-thirds vote was needed and whether they could rescind a previously approved ratification.[^23]

Callister also ruled that once Congress has set a deadline for ratification of a U.S. constitutional amendment; it cannot extend it. Congress had done so in the case of the ERA, extending the deadline for three extra years to 1982, but no additional states ratified the measure during the extension. Callister’s decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which took it up but then disposed of it in a one-sentence ruling, finding that since the deadline had passed, the case was moot. 
In 1979 National Organization for Women president, Eleanor Smeal organized a march in Washington for the Equal Rights Amendment that drew more than 100,000 men and women who demanded an extension to the 1979 deadline that Congress set for three-quarters of the states to ratify the ERA. Robust participation showed Congress that this was the will of the people, and the deadline for the states to pass the ERA was extended to June 30, 1982. "This is just the beginning,” Smeal said at that long-ago ERA march. “Liberty for women is not an idea. It is not just a hope. It is a spirit that lives in each one of us."

## New Developments

---

It has been four decades since the Equal Rights Amendment fell three states short of the thirty-eight needed for ratification to amend the U.S. Constitution, but the amendment is back in the news. In 2017, Nevada ratified the measure to guarantee equal rights for women. Nevada state Sen. Pat Spearman breathed new life into the ERA with its passage in the state Assembly and earlier in the state Senate. She sponsored the successful resolution, making Nevada the 36th state to ratify the amendment and paving the way for Illinois and Virginia to become the 37th and 38th states within the next three years. Now three-quarters of U.S. states have approved the amendment. In February, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to do away with the 1982 deadline for the ERA's passage that a previous Congress had imposed. The bill is considered unlikely to reach the floor in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opposes it. Spearman commenting on the ERA stated, “The only thing we are asking of the ERA is to acknowledge the fact that women are born equal to men. And if you are born in privilege, you have no idea what I am talking about.”
Recently, Idaho State Rep. Melissa Wintrow has sponsored HJR 003 that proposed a constitutional amendment to the Idaho Constitution to ensure equality between the sexes, much in the spirit of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. By adopting an Idaho Equal Rights Amendment, it can pave the way for equal pay, education, reproductive freedom, and more. The bill did not make it out of committee.[^24] Women won suffrage over a century ago, they have left their mark on our nation but the battle that started so many years ago continues.

## Conclusion

---

Without the ability to participate in the nations political process, women would have been ill prepared to meet the challenges they were faced with at the outbreak of World War II. They were called on to man the home front and keep America functioning while the men were off fighting the war. The results of the suffrage movement and their participation in the process gave them the confidence and exposure to take on these increased responsibilities. Role models such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Frances Perkins showed the average woman that they could do the job that was before them and that they could aspire to even greater things.

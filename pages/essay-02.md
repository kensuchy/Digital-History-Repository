# Evolution of Women's Influence in America


## Introduction

During the nineteenth century women participated in politics and society in an ancillary way by working for the abolishment of slavery and supporting their husbands in their endeavors. But since the late eighteenth century when Abigail Adams implored her husband to include women in the political process of the new nation, women have wanted to have their voices heard. As the nineteenth century turned into the twentieth century women became more visible on the political landscape. The ratification of the nineteenth amendment by Congress and the willingness of politicians such as Franklin D. Roosevelt to include women in the national arena opened the doors during World War II so women were accepted in the workplace at a time when they needed to be there and provided the self confidence in their abilities to perform whatever tasks that were put in front of them.

## The fight for Suffrage

---

 In the late 19th century less than 20% of the workforce were women. The standard for women was to be married and to work in the home raising their families. Women who lived alone were known as “women adrift” and were accounted for in a special census category.[^1] They found jobs in dressmakers’ shops, food preparation, textile mills and garment factories. These women often worked long hours per day and their pay was often reduced for minor infractions such as losing needles or using too much thread. As the Progressive movement became popular women’s rights took more of a front row seat as the movement’s issues included the family and women’s rights. Organizations such as the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and the National Woman’s Suffrage Association worked to better women’s position in society. Urban women worked to clean up neighborhoods and get funding for parks. The work of Margaret Sanger championed birth control improving public health and reducing poverty by decreasing the size of families.
 
The Women’s Christian Temperance Union lead the way for woman’s suffrage. They felt that if women could vote they would vote for prohibition and end the excesses caused by using alcohol. They ran a thriving journalistic enterprise, they marched on polls, they visited prisoners and participated in antivice crusades. Anna Howard Shaw lead the Women’s Christian Temperance Union suffrage division and when she became president of the NAWSA she brought this wealth of knowledge with her. The two main players in the fight for woman's suffrage was the NAWSA and the National Woman's Party (NWP). There were difference between the way they went about their crusade for suffrage. On one side they felt the right to vote had always belonged to them and that they needed to press for that right. This argument prompted them to take a highly visible role in getting suffrage passed including parades and poll marching. The more moderate group felt that they could show that women were good citizens and that by allowing women to vote this would create a better government. This idea fit in well with the Progressive party ideals and would appeal to the more conservative congress members. The NAWSA stated that women are keepers of their own homes by nature and training. Their desire was to do a bit of civic housekeeping and maybe even initiate an occasional "house cleaning".[^2] The natural right to vote had given way to working within the Progressive system. The NWP was seeking equality under the US political and legal framework not just being housekeepers on whatever level.

The women got their break in 1912 when the public soured on the antisuffragist lobbying by liquor dealers, textile owners and anti-reform politicians. The Progressive Party realized that they needed to empower their female allies and so they endorsed women’s suffrage. Intelligent well-spoken women began campaigning for suffrage which helped men to realize that giving them the vote would not be a terrible thing. Western states such as Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and Idaho had granted full women’s suffrage in 1900. Five more western states granted suffrage in 1912 and two more in 1917. Western states were open to new ideas and were not as dominated by vested interests as those in the east. A few states allowed women to vote in local elections but not in the national ones. Away from the suffrage front, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn an IWW organizer brought striking women together and forced the American Woolen Company to the bargaining table. The mills offered raises as well as time and a quarter for overtime. Flynn showed that women could be a force to be reckoned with as labor organizers.

## Wilson's reticence

Woodrow Wilson stated that he felt chilled and scandalized whenever he saw and heard women speak in public.[^3] During his tenure as President he would have these feelings often. Women such as Alice Paul felt that they needed to make a public spectacle to get noticed to get women’s issues pushed forward. However, Wilson did not believe that suffrage warranted a position on the national front. He continued to overlook suffrage until 1916 when he attended a convention in Atlantic City and realized that suffrage was an issue. He leant his support to it but was very ambiguous about how it was to be implemented. This prompted the NAWSA to adopt a four-prong attack. They would approach the states who had adopted woman’s suffrage to lobby the federal government to adopt a constitutional amendment. They would increase their efforts in states where legislation was pending. In states where legislation was struggling they would attempt to get referendums passed that women would be only voting in national elections. In the south where fear that women’s suffrage would reengage Blacks who had become disenfranchised, they proposed that only primary elections would be affected which were already segregated. These steps fit into the political environment and excluded Alice Paul and her direct protest methods.

As the US entered World War I Wilson had to rally groups such as the womens groups he previously had ignored. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the NAWSA, had been a member of the Woman’s Peace Party and felt strongly against involvement in the war, but she pledged NAWSA to the war effort. To garner Wilson's favor she reasoned this would cause him to make concessions on women's rights at the end of the war. NAWSA members helped Councils on Preparedness in every state and recruited women to work in food production, the American Red Cross, and aid to soldiers stationed stateside. In June 1919 Wilson kept his part of the bargain and threw his support toward congressional passage of the 19th amendment enfranchising women. Legislators throughout the south adamantly opposed it but there was nearly enough support to ratify the amendment without them. Tennessee became the swing vote and Harry T. Burn in accordance with his mother’s wishes voted to approve women’s suffrage. With his single vote, women won the right to vote.

Women considered to be adrift just decades earlier became the leaders in change for women during the 1920’s. Just five years earlier women had to have chaperones to go out in public. By 1925 women were venturing out alone or on dates with men. Their clothing changed as hem lines raised and dresses loosened. Women’s bathing suits became tank tops and shorts. All of which would have been scandalous just years earlier. Women were free to frequent dance halls where they shook their bodies to the latest tunes. Political roles expanded as they extended the concepts of municipal housecleaning towards improved sanitation, pure food and drugs laws, public transit, and new parks. Part of the hesitance in ratifying the 19th amendment was that nobody knew how they would vote. They votedn as their families did and did not establish themselves as a political block. The changes that came about were that women were more active campaigning for candidates who then nominated them for State and Local governmental positions.

Eleanor Roosevelt was the epitome of this image. She did not work for woman’s issues in and of themselves but she sought to persuade women to vote Democratic. She argued that women were different from men but they were equal to men in political rights. She fought for legal protection for working women, directed the bureau of women’s activities of the Democratic National Committee and headed the women’s advisory committee for New York governor Al Smith’s presidential campaign. She put her body and soul into her tasks and headed a loyal staff. This was further exemplified when FDR became President and Eleanor took her husbands agenda to the common people. She changed the image of the first lady and engaged herself in politics, holding press conferences about issues and working to change the publics perception of women. She continued working to get more women appointed to governmental posts.

This graph shows the use of the word woman in State of the Union speaches for the first half of the 20th century. Women are not mentioned much until Roosevelt's administration.


## Roosevelt's wisdom

---

President Roosevelt surrounded himself with talented, knowledgeable people. He appointed Frances Perkins to his cabinet. She knew his programs and what he was trying to accomplish and provided wise counsel in their implementation. She had experience in worker health and safety, statistical expertise on both employment and consumption and knowledge of women’s and children’s issues. She managed men who were reluctant to work for women and did not shy away from unpleasant tasks. Perkins furnished the brains and energy behind the New Deals most revered and lasting programs.

Roosevelt nominated Mary McLeod Bethune to the board of the National Youth Administration. This was a WPA department that trained and employed young people. She brought discriminatory actions by the program to the Presidents attention. For her actions he created a position for her as director of the NYA’s Division of Negro Affairs. He admired her as a practical politician and said of her “Mrs. Bethune is a great woman. She has her feet on the ground; not only on the ground but deep down in the ploughed soil.” [^4]She worked for substantial changes in race relations in the Roosevelt administration. Her voice was heard by the President and the First Lady.

## World War II

---

The evolution of these changes in the woman’s role were brought to fruition during World War II. In 1940 about one quarter of women were in the labor force which was about the same as in 1910. However, during the war six million women entered the work force for the first time.[^5] Gender norms were changed as men left for war and women assumed their roles in the family and in the workplace. They had to go from working in the home, subservient to their spouse to moving easily within the public workplace and controlling their family checkbook. Women became an ever-present sight in the cities as they traveled to and from work, enjoyed a social life and even dined alone. They left low paying jobs to pursue jobs with more responsibility and were a common sight in defense plants where they performed all kinds of jobs. 350,000 women joined the armed forces. Combat was closed to women but they filled the many support jobs that were available. 

## Conclusion

---

Without the ability to participate in the nations political process, women would have been ill prepared to meet the challenges they were faced with at the outbreak of World War II. They were called on to man the home front and keep America functioning while the men were off fighting the war. The results of the suffrage movement and their participation in the process gave them the confidence and exposure to take on these increased responsibilities. Role models such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Frances Perkins showed the average woman that they could do the job that was before them and that they could aspire to even greater things.
